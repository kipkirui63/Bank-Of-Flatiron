# Bank Transactions App

The Bank Transactions App is a web application that allows users to view, add, and search for their recent bank transactions. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing transactions and enables users to filter transactions by description.

## Key Features

1. **View Transactions:** Users can see a table of all their bank transactions, including the date, description, category, and amount.

2. **Add Transaction:** The app allows users to fill out and submit a form to add a new transaction. The new transaction will be added to the table, and it does not persist to the backend.

3. **Search Transactions:** Users can filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a description matching the search term will be shown in the transactions table.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS:** Styling and layout of the application.
- **npm:** Package manager for Node.js.
